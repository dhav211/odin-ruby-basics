# odin-ruby-basics

Welcome to ruby land! I was tempted to skip the ruby section and go right to rails but I decided I'd go through the ruby section as quick as I can just so I'm not short changing myself. So far ruby is a lovely language to work with, it reminds me a ton of lua!

Not really a whole lot here to talk about, they kind of just jammed a couple simple projects together for you to try hammering out a little ruby on. Definetly will take some time to learn the ruby way of doing things and I hope to get my vscode setup a little better for error checking and whatnot.

Hoping to hit the rails section by Christmas break, which then I'll take my time and absorb that information a little more through.
